> **[Ask Anton](https://aka.ms/azk-anton){:target="_blank"}**<br/>![Anton avatar.](./Instructions/Labs/media/anton-icon.png)<br/>If you have questions about some of the topics covered in this lab, *[Ask Anton](https://aka.ms/choose-anton){:target="_blank"}* is a generative AI-based agent that you can ask about AI concepts and Microsoft Foundry. Choose the Azure-based or Browser-based version of the app at **[https://aka.ms/choose-anton](https://aka.ms/choose-anton){:target="_blank"}**. In the Azure-based version, use the **Configure** button to connect the agent to a deployed model in your Foundry project. The browser-based version runs a small language model in your browser, and may run slowly on older or low-spec computers.<br/><br/>*Ask Anton is not a supported Microsoft product or a component of Microsoft Learn or AI Skills Navigator. Just an experimental example of an AI agent for you to explore as you learn about what's possible with AI.*<br/><br/>If you *do* check out Ask Anton, we'd love you to *[tell us about your experience](https://forms.office.com/r/fC0ndfBQeK){:target="_blank"}*!
